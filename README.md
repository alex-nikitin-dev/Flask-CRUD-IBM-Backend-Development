# CRUD Application with Flask

This project is a web-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Python and Flask, providing a simple interface to manage transactions in a database. The application consists of multiple web pages that allow users to add, view, edit, and delete transaction entries.

## Features

- **Create Operation**: Add a new transaction entry with date and amount details.
- **Read Operation**: View all existing transaction entries in a tabular format.
- **Update Operation**: Edit the details of an existing transaction entry.
- **Delete Operation**: Remove a transaction entry from the database.
- **Advanced Routing and Request Management**: Uses Flask's advanced routing features for efficient request handling and page navigation.
- **Multi-page Navigation**: Manages routing between multiple HTML pages to handle different operations and views.

## Project Overview

The application is structured around three main web pages:

1. **Transaction Records**: This is the main page that displays all the recorded transactions in a table format. Users can add new transactions, edit existing ones, or delete any entry directly from this page.

2. **Add Transaction**: This page is used to add new transaction entries. Users can input the transaction date and amount, which is then stored in the database.

3. **Edit Transaction**: When users choose to edit an entry from the "Transaction Records" page, they are navigated to this page. It allows users to update the date and amount for the selected transaction entry.
